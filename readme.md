# ðŸ¥‘ guac
## git under a comma
##### basically an alias manager and a bunch of mnemonics for git

### goals:
    - save keystrokes
    - provide a porcelain-like tool that lives in the shell,
        rather than in the editor
    - be fun to work with and on

### non-goals:
    - replace your favorite git tool
    - do everything git can


### Installation
clone this repo and run
`./guac -i $TARGET_DIRECTORY_ON_YOUR_PATH` (i like ~/bin/guac)


### Uninstallation
use guac's option to cleanup the symlinks you installed to a clean directory (NOT /usr/bin):

`, -u`
 [leaves behind ~/.config/guac]
